# Shape Shift

Shape Shift is a comprehensive web application designed to revolutionize personalized health and fitness. By collecting detailed user data—including sex, age, height, weight, lifestyle, activity level, goals, food preferences, equipment access, and even specific abilities or limitations—Shape Shift creates a holistic wellness plan tailored to each individual. The app offers advanced features such as intelligent food and exercise logging, which includes photo-to-text food recognition and detailed workout session tracking. Shape Shift's core strength lies in its sophisticated algorithmic and AI-driven planning: it calculates precise macronutrient needs based on basal metabolic rate and total daily energy expenditure, then uses AI to generate customized meal plans with recipes and grocery lists. For fitness, it algorithmically determines optimal workout splits and structures, while leveraging language models to fine-tune exercise selections, provide detailed instructions, and suggest modifications. With additional features like wearable device integration, an auto-populated calendar, and continual plan adjustments based on user progress and feedback, Shape Shift offers a dynamic, all-encompassing approach to achieving and maintaining health goals.
